In this article, we will give you some more details about the plot, the cast and the reception of Maine Gandhi Ko Nahin Mara. The film is based on a screenplay by Sanjay Chauhan, who was inspired by a real-life incident of a man who claimed to have killed Gandhi. The film follows the life of Professor Uttam Chaudhary (Anupam Kher), who lives with his daughter Trisha (Urmila Matondkar) and son Karan (Parvin Dabas) in Mumbai. He is a respected scholar and a former freedom fighter, but he starts to lose his memory and becomes convinced that he shot Gandhi on January 30, 1948.
 
Trisha tries to find out the root cause of her father's condition and learns that he was traumatized by the partition of India and the violence that followed. She also discovers that he had a close friend named Raju (Prem Chopra), who was killed by a mob for being a Muslim. She decides to take her father to Delhi and retrace his past, hoping to cure him of his guilt. Along the way, she meets a journalist named Ronit (Boman Irani), who helps her in her quest.
 
The film has a stellar cast of actors who deliver powerful performances. Anupam Kher is brilliant as the confused and tormented professor, who switches between lucidity and delirium with ease. Urmila Matondkar is equally impressive as the devoted and determined daughter, who faces many challenges and sacrifices to save her father. Boman Irani adds some comic relief as the cynical and witty journalist, who also develops a romantic interest in Trisha. The film also features Rajit Kapur as Gandhi's voice and Waheeda Rehman as Uttam's wife in a cameo appearance.

The film ends with a dramatic climax, where Uttam is taken to the Gandhi Smriti museum, where Gandhi was assassinated. He confronts his delusion and realizes that he did not kill Gandhi, but rather admired him and followed his principles. He also reconciles with his son, who had resented him for neglecting his family. He then collapses and dies in Trisha's arms, finally at peace with himself and his past.
 
The film was praised by critics and audiences alike for its sensitive and realistic portrayal of dementia and its impact on the family. The film also highlighted the relevance of Gandhi's teachings in the present-day scenario of India, where communal hatred and violence still persist. The film won several awards, including the National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Hindi, the Best Actor award for Anupam Kher at the Mumbai International Film Festival, the Best Director award for Jahnu Barua at the Kara Film Festival in Pakistan, and the Audience Award at the Indian Film Festival of Los Angeles.
