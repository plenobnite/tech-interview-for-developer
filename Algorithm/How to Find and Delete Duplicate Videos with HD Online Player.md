HD Online Player is a Windows utility that quickly detects video duplicate files on your computer, and can easily delete them[^4^]. It processes most codecs, finds cropped videos, rotated, noised, and with videos splitted into multiple CDs. HD Online Player provides a report of scanned files, and synchronized thumbnails of duplicate videos.
 
To use HD Online Player, you need to download and install it from the official website[^4^]. Then, you need to launch the program and select the folders where you want to scan for duplicate videos. You can also choose the scan mode: fast (only compares file names and sizes), standard (compares video content at one point), or thorough (compares video content at several points). The more thorough the scan mode, the more accurate the results, but also the longer the scan time.
 
After the scan is completed, you will see a list of duplicate videos grouped by similarity. You can preview the videos side by side, and select which ones you want to keep or delete. You can also export the scan results as a CSV file for further analysis. HD Online Player allows you to delete duplicate videos permanently, or move them to a recycle bin or a backup folder.
 
HD Online Player is a powerful and easy-to-use tool that can help you save disk space and organize your video collection. It supports native HTML video (WebM, Ogg Theora Vorbis, Ogg Opus, Ogg FLAC and MP4 H.264), MPEG-DASH and HLS streams[^2^]. You can download it for free from the official website[^4^], or use the keygen 35 to activate the full version.
  
How to Use HD Online Player to Compare Videos Side by Side
 
Another useful feature of HD Online Player is that it can compare videos side by side, and show you the differences in quality, resolution, format, or duration. This can help you decide which video to keep or delete, or to compare different versions of the same video. For example, you can compare a movie remaster with the original, or a video with different compression settings.
 
To use this feature, you need to select two videos from the scan results, and click on the "Compare" button. You will see a new window with two video players side by side. You can play, pause, rewind, or fast forward the videos simultaneously, and adjust the volume or mute each video separately. You can also switch to full screen mode for a better view.
 
HD Online Player will show you some information about each video, such as the file name, size, format, codec, resolution, duration, and bitrate. You can also see the percentage of similarity between the two videos, based on the scan mode you chose. If you want to compare more than two videos at once, you can use the "Add" button to add more video players to the window.
 
HD Online Player is a versatile and convenient tool that can help you compare videos side by side and find the best quality option for your needs. You can download it for free from the official website, or use the keygen 35 to activate the full version.
